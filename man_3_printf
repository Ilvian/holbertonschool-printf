PRINTF(3)                   BSD Library Functions Manual                   PRINTF(3)

NAME
     printf, fprintf, sprintf, snprintf, asprintf, dprintf -- formatted output conversion

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdio.h>

     int
     printf(const char *restrict format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
     The printf() function produces output according to a format as described below.

     The printf() functions return the number of characters printed, or a negative value if an output error occurs.

     The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any.  The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.

CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS
     A conversion specification consists of a %, an optional flag, an optional width or precision, and a conversion specifier.

     The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

     d, i   The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

     o, u, x, X
            The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o),
            unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation.

     c      The int argument is converted to an unsigned char.

     s      The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type.

     f, F   The double argument is output in decimal notation.

     p      The void * pointer argument is printed in hexadecimal.

     %      A % is written. No argument is converted. 

EXAMPLES
     The following example prints the number of arguments provided:

           #include <stdio.h>

           int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
               printf("%d\n", argc);
               return 0;
           }
