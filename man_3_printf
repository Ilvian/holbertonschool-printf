.SH NAME
.B _printf
\- a particular implementation of printf function.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <stdio.h>
.sp
.B int _printf(const char *format, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fB_printf\fP function produces output according to a format string. It is a custom implementation of the standard C library
\fBprintf\fP function.
.sp
The format string is composed of zero or more directives. Directives are special sequences that start with the % character,
followed by a conversion specifier.
.sp
The function handles the following conversion specifiers:
.sp
.TP
\fB%c\fP
Prints a character. The int argument is converted to an unsigned char.
.TP
\fB%s\fP
Prints a string. The const char * argument is a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string).
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.TP
\fB%d\fP
Prints a number in decimal. The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
\fB%i\fP
Prints a number as an integer.
.TP
\fB%b\fP
Converts numbers into binary values.
.TP
\fB%p\fP
Prints a pointer.
.TP
\fB%u\fP
Prints an unsigned integer.
.TP
\fB%x\fP or \fB%X\fP
Prints an unsigned hexadecimal integer. The %x format uses lowercase letters for the hexadecimal digits (a-f), and
%X uses uppercase letters (A-F).
.TP
\fB%%\fP
A literal % character.
.SH FORMAT OF THE FORMAT STRING
The format string is a character string that contains directives and ordinary characters. Ordinary characters (not %) are
copied unchanged to the output stream. Directives start with the % character and are followed by a conversion specifier.
.SH RETURN VALUES
The \fB_printf\fP function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
